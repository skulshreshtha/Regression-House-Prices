# Regression-House-Prices
Regression models to predict house prices based on Kaggle dataset. 
The dataset used can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

# Objective
I have came across multiple different approaches of tackling a regression problem but most of them focus on one or two techniques out of everything that is available out there.
Furthermore, they seem not to generalize the process much making the approach very case-specific. In this project, I am trying to lay down the fundamental template that can be utilized for majority of our regression use-case with minor changes throughout the code.
This will help in creating a mental framework around how to approach a regression problem in the future.
